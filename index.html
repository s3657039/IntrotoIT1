    <h1>About Me</h1>


    <p>Hi my name is Paul and I born in Melbourne Australian and my family background is half Macedonian and half Croatian.  I do not really speak to much of my background language, just enough to have a basic conversation. I completed my Diploma of IT at RMIT last year and am now on track to continue my studies to one day become an Industry professional. I strive to be the best version of myself that I can be, I am constantly on my journey to grow, improve and push myself to new limits with the goal to continue improving my spiritual, mental, and physical wellbeing. </p>

    <p>Now for some interesting facts about me and my personality. I love music and listen to it everyday on Spotify mainly Rap / Hip-Hop. I have a passion for martial arts and have been training ever since I could walk. My dad taught me from a young age and introduced me to this awesome world of martial arts. The main styles I practice and appreciate are Muay Thai, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and of course western boxing and in general MMA. I have trained in Thailand twice both staying at the camp Sinbi Muay Thai in Rawai for a few weeks. I currently train at team ultimate in St Alban’s and love training and working hard as it gives me a good outlet to express myself.</p>

    <p>Lastly I enjoy reading in my spare time I research topics that interest me online such as investing, gaming PC/PS4 and I also enjoy reading mainly books/ articles within the strategy / self help section. Some notable books I have read are the Hagakure – Yamamoto Tsunemoto (Bushido),, The Book of Five Rings – Myamoto Musashi, The Art of war – Sun Tzu, Cant Hurt Me – David Goggin’s (David Goggin’s is a beast and one of my idols I highly recommend you check him out) and a few transcripts/ books on Buddhism (Dalai Lama), Tao Te Ching (Taoism) and much more.</p>

    <h1>Project Idea : ASX Web Scraper / Stock Analysis & Research Tool</h1>


    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>My Project Idea is a web scraper / stock analysis & research tool. Basically, to scan companies listed on the ASX and find out important details regarding the company and also being able to do research with the program allowing it to browse and scrape the web for important and relevant articles and return the most relevant and recent news on the company to make stock analysis and research a lot quicker for a simple overview. Also of course return the share price of the company and have different price analysis options available to calculate reports and statistics based on the data scraped from the program.</p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>My motivation is simple first of all I have an interest in the world economy and the stock market and second of all an analysis tool will save me a lot of time when researching a stock as I can run the program and get recent news articles immediately as well as the stock price and financial reports. Similar to https://simplywall.st/ however this tool is to conduct research and financial evaluation with many different calculations that are not available on other financial websites. For example I can save data and run my own calculations on it and add many different equations to calculate fields and present the findings in a nice report ready to be exported to a data type of my choice or the users choice which is very handy and will increase efficiency in company analysis.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The program plan / idea is to be able to type in the code for the stock you are interested in and the program will use your input to search the web and scrape results. Providing you with the name of the company and the current stock price as well as other key statistics such as yearly-range and day range, market cap, price to earnings ratio, dividend yield. These statistics do not need to be calculated and can be scraped from the web to get live results in a neatly presented format which will save a lot of time when wanting to research a stock or even just get an update of what the price is currently at. This is the main function of the program and the overall goal of the project. However there are many other features that are lined up to be implemented after the base application / program is functional.</p>

    <p>For example the program will have options to do many different tasks and have a menu that awill take you to different paths with different tree branches of different research and analysis tools, for example (press 1 for further information) which is an option to find out further information on the company which will do a quick web scrape and return the valid data. it can retrieve information on the company such as a little overview and description of what they are about, The CEO, number of employees, Location/ Headquarters and the date they were founded present the findings in a nice readable format. 	</p>

    <p>as well as other further innovations that will come in the future down this tree line depending on research of best ways to scrape information whether ASX.com is a viable option or google finance. Based on what information is found we will have the option to conduct further research if we want to. For example, if the CEO has been found in the web scrape we can do a further web scrape and find some information about him or her using public records, articles, web searches such as Wikipedia google etc. basically this branches off into a sort of OSINT investigation tool for people and companies that will give us valuable information to learn about the business that we are looking into from an investment standpoint. This tool will be private or in beta phases until depending on how sophisticated of an analysis tool it becomes over constant improvement potentially sell it to investors who and can benefit greatly from the generated reports and extensive investigation techniques such as long-term investors or short investors looking to analyse a company.</p>

    <p>Not only will this program be able to find information on the company, return the current price but it will also have the financial tree line option to gather financial statistics such as revenue, diluted EPS, Cash on hand, Net change in cash. Get a quick summary of Financial data and reports etc. It will scrape as much as it can and store all of the data in a database. For example Q1-2020, Q2-2020, Q1-2021. There will be a wide variety of tools here where we can manipulate this data and conduct analysis based on comparing reports to the previous quarter.</p>

    <p>There will be options to export the data in SQL format, CSV and other formats which can be super handy and there will be many different calculations that we can find out for example a function to give a report if the company is Cash flow positive etc. or a volatility report where we decide to find the yearly, monthly, or daily percentage of how volatile the price has been by recording or scraping the different key price fluctuation points and using different equations to calculate this and provide reports that can be downloaded, exported or emailed to yourself (as well as many other calculations and reports). There are many other ideas to be incorporated but this is it so far.</p>

    <h1>Tools and Technologies </h1>

    <p>I will be coding the program in python and will need to do extensive research on the best and most effective ways to web scrape and parse HTML. I will be most likely using the requests package to connect to the web and collect valuable data and information which I will also most likely be using beautiful soup package to parse the HTML so it can be read and saved into python, so I can then manipulate the data and use it for the program. I will also be looking into selenium which is for JavaScript as I don’t know I will be able to scrape all the information purely with HTML. I will also need to install and run a web driver to cooperate with selenium and scrape data. Also open source websites with financial data like google finance etc. </p>
    <br></<br>
    <!--Tools and Technologies section -->
</div>

<div class="header">
    <br></<br>
    <h1>Skills Required  </h1>
    <p>Some key skills will be understanding HTML, JavaScript. Understanding the front and backend of the website and how to collect the data by sifting through code. I will also need to have a good understanding of programming in python and I will definitely be learning a lot along the way. There are also many packages that will be used with python that I will need to install such as requests and then a parsing package such as selenium and beautiful soup. I will need to do a lot of extensive research and all of it is open source and publicly available to learn which is great as well as an awesome collection of solutions and a big community for python on stack overflow.</p>
    <br></<br>

      <!--skills required section -->

  <div class="header">

    <h1>Outcome </h1>

    <p>Well the project will be successful in my eyes if I create the base application and learn a bunch of awesome python skills in the progress. If I am able to search for stocks and get the financial records in under 10 seconds with scraping everything in a nice readable format, then that is a big win in my eyes that will be very useful and help out whenever I want to look up a stock or go further with extensive analysis as well as help people do quick OSINT searches on companies finances and associated details. There will be a lot of hard work and studying different topics for this to be able to be created with a lot of innovation and upgrading as I learn new skills.</p>
